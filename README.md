# Northwind Retail & Inventory Analytics

This project uses the **Northwind SQL Server sample database** to explore retail sales and inventory performance. I wrote SQL queries to analyze key business metrics, created reusable database views for common KPIs, and prepared the results for visualization in **Power BI**.
